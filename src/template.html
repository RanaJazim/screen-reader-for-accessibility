      We are adding the new todo to the todos array and then setting state as we
      should. This will update the displayed todos in the TodoList component.
      However, since the new state is based off of the previous state, we do not
      need to pass down the todos array. Instead, we can access the previous
      todos state by writing a function within the setState function. Whatever
      we return from this function will be set as the new state. We are making
      our component do multiple things. Instead, your components should do only
      one thing and do that thing well. This is one key design principle from
      the acronym SOLID, which lays out five rules for writing more reliable
      software.
